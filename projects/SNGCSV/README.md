# SNGCSV
A little js thing to turn [Soundation](https://soundation.com/) .sng files into [midicsv](https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/) .csv files

**Problems**

When two of the same notes are played on the same track and one starts while the other is still playing, the first one goes on untill the end of the one that ends last.

It does not do effects, filters or instruments... yet (no i probably won't do anything with this)
